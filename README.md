## Features ‚ú®

# - ‚úÖ Split-Screen Browsing:
Tabinet allows users to efficiently manage and view multiple web pages simultaneously within a single window. This feature is designed to enhance productivity and streamline the browsing experience by providing a columnar layout for easy navigation and organization.

  - **Multiple Tabs in One View**: Users can open and interact with several web pages side by side, eliminating the need to switch between tabs.
    
  - **Session Management**: Each tab maintains its own navigation history, enabling users to go back and forth between pages without affecting other tabs.


# - ‚úÖ Customizable Layout:
Each column can be resized and rearranged, allowing users to customize their browsing environment to suit their needs, tab sizing from the tiniest of width and height to any size. 


# - ‚úÖ Drag-and-Drop Interface:
In addition to layout customization is the ability to drag-and-drop, the intuitive drag-and-drop functionality allows users to easily reorder columns, facilitating quick organization and access to frequently used sites.


# - ‚úÖ Incognito & Partitioning:
Tabinet uses Electron partitioning which is a way to achieve data isolation, similar to sandboxing, but with a focus on session and storage separation. This is used to create incognito tabs where any new incognito tab is **really incognito** - meaning any new incognito has a separate session and storage from other tabs.

  - **Data Isolation**: Each partition has its own separate storage, ensuring that data like cookies and cache are not shared between different partitions.
    
  - **Security and Privacy**: By isolating session data, Tabinet can enhance security and privacy, especially in scenarios where user need to handle sensitive information separately.
    
  - **Multiple Sessions**: Work multiple sessions simultaneously, each with its own state and data, which is useful for applications that need to manage multiple user accounts or              environments. Useful for **Tab farming** instead of **Phone farming**.

    
# - ‚úÖ User Agent Customization:
The User Agent Customization feature in Tabinet allows users to modify the user agent string for each tab, providing flexibility for testing and accessing different web services. This feature is particularly useful for developers and testers who need to simulate different devices or browsers, flexible for testing and accessing different web services.

  - **Default User Agents**: A set of predefined user agents for various devices (e.g., desktop, smartphone) is available for quick selection.
    
  - **Custom User Agents**: Users can add, edit, and delete custom user agents, tailoring the browsing experience to specific needs.


# - ‚úÖ Data Management:
Tabinet provides comprehensive user data management features to ensure a seamless and secure browsing experience. These features allow users to manage their browsing history, cache, and session data effectively. Every data is stored on local device, giving user power over their data.

  - **Browsing History Management**: Users can view, delete, and manage their browsing history. The history is grouped by date, making it easy to navigate and manage past activities.
    
  - **Cache Management**: Users can clear the cache to free up space and improve performance. This feature is accessible through a simple interface, ensuring that users can maintain 
      optimal application performance.

The Kanban feature in Tabinet provides users with a visual and interactive way to manage tasks and projects. This feature is designed to enhance productivity by allowing users to organize tasks into columns, representing different stages of a workflow.
